Created for Global Game Jam 2025, Wreck Divers is a game about exploring the depths of the ocean to find lost treasures. You play as a diver who must navigate through the treacherous monster infested waters to find the hidden loot. But beware, the monster is great at smelling you breathe...


This was created by a team of 4 people (Amber, Alec, Izzy and Tom) over 3 days.
It was a really fun project to create!
